# TensorFlow Analysis on Kaggle Titanic Data
This notebook represents my solution to the Kaggle starter competition on the Titanic dataset.  The objective is to
predict whether or not certain passengers survive, based on several variables, such as age, class, and sex.  My
analysis made use of TensorFlow to train a deep neural network on the provided training data (train.csv), then made
predictions for the test data (test.csv).  The analysis takes place in the Jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb, and the
predictions are saved to my_submission.csv.
